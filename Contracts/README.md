# Instruction 

In order to, to execute the Blockchain experiments, we need to ;
 - Configure a Blockchain
 - Deploy a web service to simulate the PPRL participants
 - Deploy the Semi-Trusted Third Party Smart Contract 



## Blockchain 

The experiments can be executed in two scenarios; i) in a private Ethereum network or ii) in the public Ethereum network. 

To execute the private Ethereum network, we recommend the use of a docker environment to build the test netwok. A detailed tutorial is provided in this [repository](https://github.com/Capgemini-AIE/ethereum-docker). 

To use the public Ethereum network follow the instruction provided in this [tutorial](https://medium.com/swlh/deploy-smart-contracts-on-ropsten-testnet-through-ethereum-remix-233cd1494b4b).
